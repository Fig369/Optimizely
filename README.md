## What is Optimizely?

**Optimizely** is a platform that specializes in experimentation and optimization of digital experiences. It allows businesses to conduct A/B testing, multivariate testing, and personalization of their websites, mobile apps, and other digital content.

Here's a breakdown of what Optimizely offers:

1. **Experimentation**: Optimizely enables businesses to test different versions (variants) of their digital experiences to see which performs best. This could involve testing different layouts, headlines, images, or other elements on a webpage or app.

2. **A/B Testing**: This is a common testing method where two versions (A and B) of a webpage or app are compared to see which one achieves better results based on predefined metrics such as conversion rates, click-through rates, or engagement.

3. **Multivariate Testing**: Optimizely allows for more complex testing scenarios where multiple elements on a webpage or app can be tested simultaneously to identify the best combination of elements.

4. **Personalization**: The platform enables personalized experiences based on user behavior, demographics, or other factors. This means showing tailored content or offers to different segments of users to improve engagement and conversions.

5. **Analytics and Insights**: Optimizely provides detailed analytics and reporting to track the performance of experiments. Users can gather insights into how changes impact user behavior and make data-driven decisions.

6. **Feature Flagging**: This feature allows businesses to roll out new features gradually to specific user segments, reducing risk and enabling controlled feature releases.
